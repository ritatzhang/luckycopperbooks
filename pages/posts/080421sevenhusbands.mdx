# 🤵‍♂️🤵‍♂️🤵‍♂️🤵‍♂️🤵‍♂️🤵‍♂️🤵‍♂️🤵‍♂️ (8) / 10 husbands

full of unexpected twists and was definitely a fun, worthwhile read! i am writing this review
nearly six months post read so i remember very little.

## these are the quotes i highlighted:

> "the world doesn't give things, you take things."

this was **evelyn's reflection on her first husband**. i felt like i was in a similar relationship
with an ex as well. it was a relationship where i felt uncomfortable being fully myself. now,
i'm happy i'm able to recognize what being myself feels like, and i hope i won't feel like that
in a romantic relationship again.

> "I'd told him I was someone else. And then I started getting angry that he couldn't
> see who I really was."

> "People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you
> can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them
> bare and their response is 'You're safe with me' -- that's intimacy."

> "Passion never mattered very much to me. But that type of intimacy that we had? That was what I
> cherished."

**what matters to you more? intimacy, or passion?** i think for me, it would be passion.

**ruby getting rekt:**

> "I wasn't mad at Ruby for telling Celia what I'd told her, the same way you're not mad
> at a dog for barking at a mailman. That's just what they do."

this book touched on a bit of **gender roles**, and i particularly liked this quote:

> "You wonder what it must be like to be a man, to be so confident that the final say is yours."

overall, this is a book about relationships of all different kinds: platonic, romantic, familial,
mainly focusing on the complexities of each relationship.
