# 🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛ (6) / 10 talking black cats

i read this book because everyone talks about it but it kind of went over my head. i wish i was
intellectual to enjoy it more but honestly, i just am not that person. it is surprisingly **sexual** and
graphic. :o

## quotes i guess

kind of **how i feel** about myself lolz:

> "she's not so wild about her own looks, but she seems comfortable with who she is, and that's
> the important thing."

i would say that i like the way murakami writes, i.e. **the personficiation here**:

> "Her smile steps offstage for a moment..."

**coincidences** (i agree):

> "That even in a smallest events there's no such thing as coincidence."

**kafka and books:**

> "Slowly, like a movie fadeout, the real world evaporates. I'm alone, inside the world
> of the story. My favorite feeling in the world."

**kafka and priorities:**

> "The longer people live, the more they learn to distinguish what's imporant from what's not."

what's important to me right now? i want to cherish and give time and attention to my closest friends
and family. i want to learn and have a sponge brain. i don't want to get caught up in materialism and
spedning inertia (my biggest weakness). i want to make my interactions with people meaningful. i want
to grow in empathy and consideration for others.
