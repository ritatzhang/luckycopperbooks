# 👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️(8) / 10

i really enjoyed this book. it is thought-provoking, surprising, and
powerful. the characters are likeable and real and you are able to truly
empathize with them. i'm not sure what the intended message of the book
was exactly, but one of my takeaways is that racism isn't just about
the color of someone's skin. the people of mallard had the same physical
appearance as whites, but they were treated like lower class citizens.
why is that? how did racism become so ingrained in our society? how are
we able to pick up on these invisible cues that notify ourselves that
someone is a different race than us?

i didn't highlight as many quotes in this book. i think while there may have
been less super strong individual quotes, the overarching story was still
very strong.

## quotes

**transparancy**

> "Jude hated the idea of being so transparent to anyone, ever her own
> mother."

i forgot why i highlighted this. maybe because i felt invisible to my mom?
i'm not sure invisible is the true proper way i feel though ... it's
something else ...

**family matters**

> "She'd already acted as if notifying her of her grandmother's passing
> had been some inconvenience. What type of life did her mother think she
> was living that she couldn't interrupt with that type of news."

when my dad had knee surgery, none of my parents told me. my brother told
me on the operation day. my mom said it was because she didn't want me to
worry. i guess it's nice that they're trying to protect me, but seriously,
how do they see my life? my priorities? that i shouldn't know what is
happening to my father? it makes me really sad, this idea that they feel like
they are less important to me than my schoolwork is.

**death**

> "That was the thing about death. Only the specifics of it hurt. Death, in a
> general sense, was background noise."

everyone else continues their normal lives while this terrible thing has happened.
i think this was something very hard to come to terms with about death. to
everyone else, it is just background. their lives weren't changed like yours
was.
