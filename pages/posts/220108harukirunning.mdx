# 🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃(7) / 10

i liked this book because i could relate to so many of the things that
murakami said. i also liked that it humanized such a decorated author.
i am also realizing that many of my reviews get 7's. this is because
i typically think a book is pretty good unless it is like clearly very
bad. i am just realizing that i have not included the book "verity" by
colleen hoover in my reviews. i wonder how it slipped past me ...
anyways that book was like a 5. even though the plot was interesting,
there were too many unnecesary sex scenes so it seemed like a glorified
fanfiction. ANYWAYS this book, the murakami book, is worth the read for
sure if you have previously read any of murakami's books before and
have had experience with long-distance running (this isn't a requirement
but would help with relating to the book i think).

## the quotes i highlighed

**murakami is funny!**

> "a real gentleman never discusses women he's broken up with or how
> much tax he's paid. actually this is a total lie. I just made it up.
> Sorry!"

> "if they were to make a movie about my life (just the thought of which
> scares me)"

> "at this point I don't want to mix music and computers."

he's so funny! i feel like we'd really get along!

**meditative power of running**

> "no matter how mundane some action might appear, keep at it long enough
> and it becomes a comtemplative, even meditative act."

this is how i feel about running and swimming. a really good time to think.

**pacing while running**

> "To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important
> thing for long-term projects. Once you set the pace, the rest will follow."

for running, setting an acheivable pace in the beginning is an incredibly
important factor for determing whether you will be able to finish your race.
i've never really applied that mindset to other long-term projects, but to
be honest, i haven't really had many long-term projects (this is based on a
loose definition of long-term). perhaps, one place where i could've used
this advice is in my college academics. i feel so burnt out. i feel like i
ran a fast and difficult first half, and now i have nothing left. i am
tired. i don't know what i have left inside of me.

**growing old**

> "When I was young, being asked to imagine myself at fifty was as difficult
> as being asked to imagine, concretely, the world after death."

this is where i am currently in my life.

> "And now here I am living in this unimaginable world. It feels really strange,
> and I can't tell if I'm fortunate or not. Maybe it doesn't matter."

I am watching my father reach this age. he has chronic knee pain and recently
has began experiencing loss of feeling in his wrist where he may have to undergo
spinal surgery. i'm scared and i'm really really sad. there's nothing i can do for
him, even though i know this is painful for him physically and emotionally. he is a
man that swims, runs, works with his hands. i know how hard it must be
to slowly lose these things that you once did that made you YOU.

additionally, in accordance with this topic:

> "looking back now, I think the most forunate thing is that I was born
> with a strong, healthy body."

> "one of the privileges given to those who've avoided dying young is
> the blessed right to grow old. the honor of physical decline is waiting,
> and you have to get used to that reality."

**priorities**

> "you really need to priortize in life, figuring out in what order you
> should divide up your time and energy. if you don't get that sort of system
> set by a certain age, you'll lack focus and your life will be out of
> balance."

i think this was an interesting quote because in the previous review (midnight
library), i touched on how i want to experience so much of life. but i can't.
i need to figure out what is worth to me to experience.

**thoughts during a marathon**

> "...i gradually start to get angry. angry at the sheep happily munching
> grass in an empty lot next to the road, angry at the photographer snapping
> photos from inside the van."

then after the run,

> "Strangely, I have no feeling of accomplishment. The only thing I feel
> is utter relief that I don't have to run anymore."

during my marathon, i started crying when people cheered for me. i was
delusional and brain dead and unable to emote properly. i was so tired.

**miscellaneous**

> "Marathon runners will understand what I mean."

> "I prefer the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Gorillaz, and Beck, and oldies like
> Creedence Clearwater Revival and the Beach Boys."

> "People's minds can't be a complete blank. Human beings' emotions are not
> strong or consistent enough to sustain a vacuum."

> "I didn't start running because somebody asked me to become a runner...
> one day, out of the blue, I started to run--simply because I wanted to."
