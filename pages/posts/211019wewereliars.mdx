# ğŸ¤¥ğŸ¤¥ğŸ¤¥ğŸ¤¥ğŸ¤¥ğŸ¤¥ (6) / 10 liars

this was a pretty quick read. not too long and pretty dramatic. worth reading until the end. (it is
important to read until the end)

## quotes

**family:**

> "I love him, but I'm not sure I like him."

> "That woman buys things just to buy things. It's disgusting."

the above quote was about the main character's mom. but it could also be applied to my mom... brb crying rn

**good advice:**

> "Be a little kinder than you have to."

i think the main idea of this book is **youth, growing up, and the kind of people you grow into as adults.**
it's not unknown that life is hard. being an adult is hard.

> "He cried like a man, not like a boy. Not like he was frustrated or hadn't gotten his way, but
> like life was bitter. Like his wounds couldn't be healed."
