# 🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎 (7) / 10

really good writing but i just finished it and i'm really sad bro... this book is UNREAL in the
way that it MESSES with your emotions. someone else described the style of writing to me as emotional
abuse because as soon as something good happens, something bad follows. it gets you high only
to bring you down ...

if you want to feel things, you should read this book. it gets very heavy at times but i'm really
glad that i read it. it definitely gave me perspectives into lives that i would've never had a look
into otherwise. a look into lives of people who had much more difficult lives than me.

i'm pretty heartbroken. i am clearly pretty sheltered because when i read this book, it was hard for
me to fathom a world that could even be that bad. that people could be _that_ bad. but there is also
good. you will cry and smile reading this book (guaranteed).

main takeaways: life is hard. ADULT life is complicated.

## memorable quotes

**seeing your friends outside the realm of which you know them** (an interesting concept):

> "He got to see his friends differently, not as just appendages to his life but as distinct
> characters inhaviting their own stories; he felt sometimes that he was seeing them for the
> first time, even after so many years of knowing them."

**about chasing your dreams:**

> "When did pursuing your ambitions cross the line from brave into foolhardy? How did you
> know when to stop?"

here are my crazy dreams: owning a cafe, finishing an ironman, attending a fashion week.

**happiness is a symptom** not an end goal:

> "There were times when the pressure to achieve happiness felt almost oppressive, as if happiness
> were something that everyone should and could attain, and that any sort of compromise in its pursuit
> was somehow your fault."

**why i want to go to new york~!!!!!** new yawk

> "New York was populated by the ambitious. It was often the only thing that everyone here had
> in common"

as an adult, **your relationship with your family becomes optional**

> "'But they're your parents,' Malcolm said to him once a year or so. 'You can't just stop
> talking to them.' But you could, you did: he was proof of that."

**the value of diverse opinions**

> "his friends, who thought so differently than he did and who made him think differently
> as well"

**practical quote** about healthcare and how taxing it can be on families:

> "I would think of how difficult, how impossible it must be for parents who didn't have the
> connections we did, who didn't Liesl's scientific literacy and knowledge."

> "I would walk through campus and overhear conversations -- someone talking about splitting up
> wither her boyfriend ... -- and would feel rage. You stupid, petty, selfish, self-absorbed people, I
> wanted to say. You hateful people, I hate you. Your problems aren't problems. My son is dying."

this quote really hit home for me because when i had cancer, me and my parents felt so overwhelmed
by all of the doctors and information overload. every other problem seemed so insignificant.

**how lucky we are to have parents**

> "he cries and cries...for the shame and joy of finally getting to be a child, with all of
> a child's whims and wants and insecurities, for the pribilege of behaving badly and being forgiven,
> for the luxury of tendernesses, of fondnesses,... at last, of believing a parent's reassurances, of
> believing a parent's reassurances, of believing that to someone he is special despite all his mistakes
> and hatefulness, because of all his mistakes and hatefulness."

more specific takeways _AKA SPOILERS AHEM_:

i thought malcolm seemed shallow in the beginning of the book, but he's definitely someone i grew
to admire as more sides of him were revealed, especially after his death. he truly cared for jude.
all of them did. they had a really specially friendship.

bro. willem dying -- i actually couldn't handle it. and then . jude. bro. my heart is so broken
for HAROLD AND JULIA !! i feel like they lost three children.
