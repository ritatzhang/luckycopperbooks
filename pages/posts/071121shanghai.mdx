# ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‘˜ðŸ‘˜ / 10 kimonos that we have to pretend are cheongsams

pretty good book, but ended up being a tragedy (in my opinion). bad stuff
happens, and it sucks. and when you think the bad stuff is done happening,
and that pearl and may (the two sister protagonists I AM JUST REALIZING I
DIDN'T REALLY SUMMARIZE MY TWO PREVIOUS REVIEWS) have suffered enough and are
finally in a good place, something insanely tragic happens.

anyways, it was still a lovely story to see character growth in self-awareness
and a small peephole view into what china was like in the 1930s, during the japanese
invasion. and then to see what it was like to immigrate into a very anti-chinese
america.

### as usual, most noteable quotes:

**a women's role in china** was bad in the 1930s (just like most countries), but
i wonder how it is now. it seems bad in chinese dramas i will be honest.

> "confucious, who wrote, 'an educated woman is a worthless woman.'"

**mother's**

> "maybe we're all like that with our mothers. they seem ordinary until one day
> they're extraordinary."

**men vs women**

> "we're told that men are strong and brave, but i think women know how to endure,
> accept defeat, and bear physical and mental agony much better than men" -- there is
> no truer testimate to this than childbirth.

**the chinese desire of secrecy**

> "for years same and i have been torn between the american desire to share, be honest,
> and tell the truth to joy and our held chinese belief that you never reveal anything."

i think my parents must experience something like this, since i hardly know anything about
their childhood or who they were before me and my siblings.

**a father's love**

> "when joy starts huring her father... she's like a pearl in his palm--
> forever previous; to joy, he's the solid ground on which she walks--
> forever steady and reliable... he's loved joy without regret, without conditions, without
> once holding back his heart."

this honestly hurt read again. sam's (pearl's husband) love
for joy was so deep and selfless and it only hurts more as you keep reading.
(sorry no spoilers from me!)
