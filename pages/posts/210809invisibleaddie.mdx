# ðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š (7) / 10 book stacks

objectively good book. i like the way that it is written and takes you through time. i'm going to
try harder to be timely with these reviews because so much time has passed that i no longer know
what to say.

my only reflection is that i've heard people say they love this book. i thought it was good, but
clearly not too memorable.

## quotes:

**addie and books:**

> "Books, she has found, are a way to live a thousand lives -- or to find strength in a very
> long one."

**addie and secrets:**

> "It is so much easier to share a secret than to keep one."

**addie and a struggling artist:**

> "'It is good work,' he says. But under his words, a softer sound, the rumble of his stomach."

ok after reading my quotes I think I liked this book more than I remember. it shows so many
aspects of humanity and the ~existential struggle~
