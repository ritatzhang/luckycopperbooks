I just finished this flight on another flight home from a very, very
pleasant trip. I feel very raw. and sort of unhappy. there’s no real
conclusion to the story. I guess that was supposed to be an admirable artistic choice
by rooney.

this story is about two friends, marianne and connell, who
became familiar with each other since connell’s mother was employed to
clean marianne’s mother’s house. they have known each other since grade
school, where marianne was an outcast and connell was popular. they
began a secret relationship in high school and eventually went to the
same college together. in college, their roles reversed—-marianne became
popular and connell became isolated and their romantic relationship was
extremely on and off, and a bit confusing and frustrating for the reader
at times. they always seemed to best friends though and together, they
changed a lot as people. I think that’s what made this book such an
interesting read. it feels very human, the way they change and seem to
grow more in pain as they navigate post high school childhood. they have
complex attitudes and dark, blunt thoughts which I think are inherent to
human nature. they might exhibit a bit much of an “i’m weird” jughead-style attitude at times.

I would also like to make note of the fact of the possibility of marianne having
an eating disorder. rooney mentioned an impossible to ignore amount of
times how little marianne ate and how frail she looked (marianne would
have a coffee and half a pastry for breakfast, and then not eat again
until 8 or 9 pm). it was never explicitly mentioned whether she had an
eating disorder but please be weary of this before reading the book.
some people on the internet say rooney romanticized marianne’s eating
disorder. i’m not really sure if I agree or not about that but I think I
can see where those critics are coming from.

rooney’s writing style is
pretty direct with moments of mockingly convoluted sentences mixed in. I
like her blunt humor:

> “He (Connell) heard Paula saying: You’re so hard.
> That was an especially insane thing for her to say, because he actually
> wasn’t.”

### Other quotes I liked:

the sexiest argument for capitalism i’ve ever heard --

> “That’s money, the substance that makes
> the world real. There’s something so corrupt and sexy about it.”

i really felt this in my core, since i was just experiencing life's
little joys again after college had stripped so much of my personality and passions away --

> “…he (Connell) felt the old beat of pleasure inside his body, like watching a perfect goal, like
> the rustling movement of light through leaves, a phrase of music from
> the window of a passing car. Life offers up these moments of joy despite
> everything.”

as mentioned in the beginning
of this review, i’m on a flight home from flagstaff, arionza after
staying with a friend for a week. it’s really special there. very small
town, big nature people vibe. it helped me put some things in
perspective, after existing in a very success = good grades/career state of mind.
it’s ok to want a life outside of the money making box and to
have passions outside of having a really sparkly career. I still don’t
know what I want. but I hope I can find it soon.
