# ðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“šðŸ“š (7) / 10

really interesting concept and solid execution. satisfying enough ending too.
again, this is another book where i waited too long to write a review so
i don't really remember any specific details (i know .. i'm so sorry).

## here are my quotes or whatever ...

**a sylvia plath quote, referenced in the book:**

> "I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want.
> I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want?
> I want to live and feel all the shades, tones, and variations of mental
> and physical experience possible in my life."

i relate to this heavily because i feel like there is so much this world
has to offer that i want to experience. lately though, i've been losing
the motivation i once had to go after these things ...

**emotional disclosure difference**

> "The emotion people store in you, like a bad investment. You feel like
> you are robbing people of something."

as someone that finds it hard to open up to others, i am always really
surprised when someone opens up to me so readily. what have i done to
earn this responsibility? how is it so easy to trust someone else with
such personal information? i always feel very lucky after an exchange like
this, that i got to see a little more of a person. but i still want to be
careful about who i share information with.

**dunbar's number**

> "Rober Dunbar...who had discovered that human beings were wired to know
> only a hundred and fifty people, as that was the average size of
> hunter-gatherer communities."

interesting concept that i feel is based in truth.

**miscellaneous quotes**

> "It's like how humans never see the second hand of a clock mid-tick"

> "'I am Mrs Elm. Louise Isabel Elm' 'Are you God?' She smiled
> 'I am who I am.'"
