# 🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀 (8) / 10 witchy flowers

finished this while on a family camping trip. this review is being written a
month later though (so sorry for forgetting things!). i was very concerned at first
that circe was turning into a super villain after discover her powers, but instead,
you get to watch her grow into a mature, good-hearted goddess (tbd).

even though she is a goddess, she observes and reveals many truths about humanity.

### memorable quotes

circe, about daedalus:

> "but in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul
> dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. such a constellation
> was he to me."

daedalus, about being trapped by pasiphae and minos:

> "a golden cage is still a cage."

circe, after turning some pirates into pigs:

> "the truth is, men make terrible pigs."
