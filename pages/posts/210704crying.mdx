# 🍲🍲🍲🍲🍲🍲🍲 (7) / 10 bowls of soup

i really wanted to read this because it had asian-american themes and also
because i heard it was a very emotional book. and i was ready to cry!!!
while i did cry and i did hear many truths that spoke to deep, buried
memories of my own that i had, i'm not sure it had the deep residual impact
that i was looking for. i think that's partly due to the fact that it had a
huge focus on specifically the _korean_-american experience, while i am chinese.
additionally, there was a huge focus on the **food** aspect of korean-american
culture. while food was integral to my own upbringing, i don't think i related
to food on the same level zauner did (i recently realized i'm more an eat to
live person than live to eat).

### nevertheless, good quotes:

**the grief michelle felt after her mother passed:**

> "my grief comes in waves and is usually triggered by something arbitrary."
> this is how i felt about stress and anxiety and later, my own grief in high school.
> i was always able to bottle things up, act like i was okay, until one minor
> inconvenience would break me.

**the love michelle experienced from her mother:**

> "in subtle observations of what brought you joy, pocketed away to make you
> feel comforted and cared for without even realizing it."

i think this is my love language. it's not just it's gifts, it's only gifts that
would show a deep understanding of what i'm passionnate about and what i want. it's
not just quality time. it's time spent matching what i need at that moment; studying,
lying down, swimming. it's not just python. it's a perfectly efficient linear big o
function (heh).

**white people:**

> "white people were always going to the doctor" -- so true!

**the specifice nightmares she had as a child, which i had too, so it was a nice surprise to
hear that someone else experienced them too:**

> "nightmares and an intense paranoia of my paretns dying."
> "I was convinced they'd gotten into a car accident" -- i always jump to this conclusion as well.

**her mother's philosophy about food:**

> "she believed food should be enjoyed and that it was more of a waste to expand your
> tomach than to keep eating when you were full. her only rule was that you had to try everything
> once" -- these are good words to live by.

**a part of american culture she missed out on:**

> "i was not given an old edition of cather in the rye as a preteen, copies of rolling
> stones records on vinyl, or any kind of instructional material from the past that might help
> give me a leg up to cultural maturity."

this is sort of a little talked about immigrant experience: the experiences we missed.
i didn't really know the beatles or michael jackson or other huge cultural icons. and
my parents never talked about any cultural icons from their youth in china (i guess
all they had was mao zedong tbh).

**fruit cutting:**

> "halmoni [michelle's grandmother] would take bites from the core so none of the fruit
> would go to waste, while my mom ate from the perfectly cut slivers, just as i did when she
> cut fruit for me at home."

**her mother's experience immigrating:**

> "i didn't think about the guilt she might have felt for all the years spent away from her
> mother, for leaving korea behind."

this has been something i've been thinking about more. since it's so hard for me to imagine
leaving everything i've ever known, all my friends and family, and uprooting my life to an
entirely new country. giving up years of time that could've been spent with my parents, not
being able to be beside them as they died -- all things my parents gave up for me.

**er apartment in nyc:** (insert super funny excerpt on page 38. it was too long
but definitley worth picking up this book for.)

**how michelle lived during her young adult years:** "scarcity mentality"

**mothers:**

> "their identities were absorbed by their children." -- after thinking about this, i realize
> i only know many adults by their relation to their children (caitlyn's dad, joy's mom, etc).

short aside: michelle's love story was worth reading for as well. it was sort of a side plot
in the book (even saying it's a side plot is pretty generous), but her wedding vows made me
shed a tear (will i ever be in love!?!??!).

**how life carries on in the wake of personal tragedy:**

> "none of these people could know what had just happened, but still i wondered if they
> could see it on my face. when i realized they clearly couldn't, it somehow also felt wrong.
> it felt wront to talk to anyone, to smile or laugh or eat again knowing that she was dead."
