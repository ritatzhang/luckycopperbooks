# ðŸ«€ðŸ«€ðŸ«€ðŸ«€ðŸ«€ðŸ«€ðŸ«€ðŸ«€ (8) / 10 anatomically correct hearts

this is the second book iâ€™ve finished in a long hiatus from reading
(first book was the north american teenagerâ€™s field notes â€” or something
like that; it was just ok). darius the great deserves better is the
second book in a series. I remember reading the first one, and feeling
the iciness of my heart crack just a little. darius is a gentle
boy and thereâ€™s something about the hearing his inner thoughts that
makes your entire heart root for him, hurt when he hurts, tear up when
he tears up.

since the first book, darius is home from iran and heâ€™s joined the soccer
team. as you watch him navigate new relationships, you
donâ€™t just fall in love with darius, you grow empathetic towards his
entire family, his close friends, and even his soccer coach. everyone in
his story plays an important role in his life and I really enjoyed
reading the way that those around him learn to support him through loss,
depression, and a high school bully (fricking trent). iâ€™m not very
eloquent but I think iâ€™m going to try to read more book reviews so I
know what to talk about. overall, I really enjoyed this book and how it
portrayed mental health and intersectional identity. next time iâ€™m going
to try to highlight the quotes that I think are meaningful!

on a more personal note, I finished the majority of this book while
flying back home from a fun-packed week in California, visiting friends
from CMU. i teared up a decent amount on the plane. I think reading this
book put me in a very bittersweet reflective mood. iâ€™m so lucky to have
the friends I do, that they would give up a whole week of their time to
hang out with me and that they would let me stay in their houses. I feel
really lucky and happy and justâ€¦ my heart is so full :â€™) even though I feel
really grateful for my friends, sometimes I have the same ugly feelings
darius has. I try to hide them, but I know iâ€™m not that good at it.
feelings of inadquecy, like iâ€™m not a good enough friend or I say the
wrong things, and jealousy â€” which is my least favorite feeling. I read
something in ophrahâ€™s magazine that maybe I need to do more
self-reflection and meditation so that things donâ€™t rile me up as
easily. I should really try itâ€¦

another thing that broke my heart about
this book is dariusâ€™ relationship with his family and parents. I think
me and my parents have sort of a broken relationship. I love them and I
know that they love me but I feel so distant from them. I donâ€™t know
much about how they grew up and they donâ€™t know much about my personal
life. they feel so far away sometimes that I donâ€™t know how I would ever
bridge the gap between us. darius had a similar relationship issues with
his father in the first book, and then again with his grandmothers in
the second book. sometimes reading what darius had with his family made
me sad since it was such a stark contrast from me and my parents, but I
have hope for us.
